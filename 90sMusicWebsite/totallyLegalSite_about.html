                        Hello! This is a project by Shareen Esmail to create a 90's inspired Website. What do you think? 
                        <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The songs themselves are not from the 90's (as far as she knows) but the idea behind it was that
                        since the <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; internet was a new and interesting place, there was not many security measures. So, instead
                        of spending <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; money to by songs, most people would pirate them to burn on their CD's 
                        (an old fashioned storage device <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;for you youngin's). So this website is totally 100% not an 
                        illegal website to download songs and 110% <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; works full and nothing cound ever go wrong.
                        <br><br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;...
                        <br><br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;.....
                        <br><br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;......
                        <br>
                        <br> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ANYWAY! Shareen needs to sleep because she is talking outloud in the 3rd person to type this.
                        Goodnight!
